This is the Android Application for our 2nd year project. We are Julia Wong, Dexter Fung, Yvonne Kong and Son Dang.
The app's name is RecipEZ, designed to help students and adults adopt a healthier lifestyle by eating home-cook meals instead of fast food.
Users can select among easy and cheap recipes of different categories, or choose their meal based on the ingredients already in the fridge. 
They may also track their leftovers expiry date in their fridge to avoid food waste.
